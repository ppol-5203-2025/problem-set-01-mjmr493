## Replication Materials for Question 01

Abstract: This project analyzes data in a particular context that contributes to the overall body of work in this field. Our analysis shows that the results were aligned with the project goals. Analysis used a processed version of our data to makes our results relevant.

### Tutorial

This README file provides an overview of the replication materials for this project. The Python codes used for this project can be found under the folder \textbf{code}. The data used in this project can be found in the \textbf{data} folder, with subfolders \textbf{raw_data} and \textbf{processed_data} indicating the unprocessed and clean data files used in this analysis. The \textbf{output} folder also has subfolders, \textbf{01_main_figures} and \textbf{01_appendix_figures}, contains the outputs for figures in the main project and appendix respectively.

### Code

- `01_data_processing.py` (does all the processing of the data);
- `02_main_results.py` (runs the main results of the paper); 
- `03_additional_analysis.py` (additional analysis of main paper);
- `04_appendix_results.py` (runs all the results of the appendix);

### Data

In the subfolder `raw_data`:
- `raw_data_survey_qualtrics.csv` (clean data)

In the subfolder `processed_data`:
- `clean_data.json` (raw data)


### Output

In the subfolder `01_main_figures`
- `figure_1.png` (figure 1)
- `figure_2.png` (figure 2)
- `figure_3.png` (figure 3)
- `figure_4.png` (figure 4)
- `figure_5.png` (figure 5)

In the subfolder `01_appendix_figures`
- `01_figure_appendix_hetergenous_effects.png` (Figure 1 from the appendix with heteregenous effects)
- `02_figure_appendix_polarization_results.png` (Figure 2 from the appendix results for polarization)
- `03_figure_appendix_robustness_checks.png` (Figure 3 from the appendix for robustness checks)
